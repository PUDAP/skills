# PUDA experimental data

Use the bundled Python modules to extract measurements, analyze results, hash provenance, export data, plot results, and generate experiment reports. Built-in device adapters cover First and Biologic; measurement types include CV, OCV, CA, PEIS, and a GEIS fallback.

## Start with the requested operation

Resolve this skill's installed directory and add its `scripts/` directory to Python's import path; do not hard-code a user or agent installation path. Run from the intended project root or set `PUDA_PROJECT_ROOT` **before importing modules**, since paths are discovered at import time. Install `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` if missing.

Inspect the live schema with `puda db schema` before writing custom queries; use the bundled scripts as the source of truth for function signatures.

| Task | Read when needed | Python entrypoints |
|---|---|---|
| Find runs, load measurements, or resolve paths | [Extraction](references/extraction.md) | `extractor`, `config` |
| Hash or verify data | [Hashing](references/hasher.md) | `hasher` |
| Demonstrate tamper detection | [Provenance demo](references/provenance-demo.md) | `hasher.demonstrate_integrity` |
| Export CSV, JSON, or an experiment | [Exporting](references/exporting.md) | `exporter` |
| Plot measurements or compute summaries | [Plotting](references/plotting.md) | `plotter` |
| Analyze or interpret experiment results | [Analysis workflow](references/analysis.md) | `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` |
| Generate an experiment report | [Reporting workflow and builder](references/report.md) | `report` |
| Add device schemas, adapters, or plotters | [Extension contracts](references/extending.md) | `registry`, `adapters`, `plotter` |

Read only the references and script implementations needed for the selected operation. Keep run IDs, metadata, and SHA-256 provenance with exported/report data so results can be traced back to their source.
