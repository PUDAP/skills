# PUDA Machines

## Goal

Provide machine-selection and capability guidance for PUDA workflows, then load the correct machine reference before generating commands.

## Critical Rule

If you are unsure which machine should be used for a command, **ask the user** before proceeding.  
Do **not** assume.

## Machine Capabilities and When to Use

### First Machine (`machine_id: "first"`)

Use for **liquid handling and deck operations**.

Capabilities:
- Pipetting workflows: aspirate, dispense, attach tip, drop tip
- Deck and labware workflows: load deck, position-dependent operations
- Sequenced robotic handling steps in wet-lab protocols

Use this machine when:
- The task is about moving liquids between wells/labware
- The user mentions tip usage, aspiration/dispensing, or deck slots/labware setup

Before command generation:
- Refer to: [first-machine](references/first-machine.md)
- Run `puda machine commands first` to understand available commands
- Follow constraints and sequencing in `references/first-machine.md`

### PipQuBotV3 Machine (`machine_id: "pipqubotv3"`)

Use for **liquid handling and deck operations**.

Capabilities:
- Pipetting workflows: aspirate, dispense, attach tip, drop tip
- Deck and labware workflows: load deck, position-dependent operations
- Sequenced robotic handling steps in wet-lab protocols

Use this machine when:
- The task is about moving liquids between wells/labware
- The user mentions tip usage, aspiration/dispensing, or deck slots/labware setup

Before command generation:
- Refer to: [pipqubotv3-machine](references/pipqubotv3-machine.md)
- Run `puda machine commands pipqubotv3` to understand available commands
- Follow constraints and sequencing in `references/pipqubotv3-machine.md`

### Biologic Machine (`machine_id: "biologic"`)

Use for **electrochemical testing and characterization**.

Capabilities:
- OCV (Open Circuit Voltage)
- CA (Chronoamperometry)
- PEIS / GEIS (Impedance spectroscopy)
- CV (Cyclic Voltammetry)
- MPP variants (MPP, MPP_Cycles, MPP_Tracking)

Use this machine when:
- The task is an electrochemical measurement or battery/cell characterization
- The user asks for OCV, CA, EIS, CV, or MPP tests

Before command generation:
- Refer to: [biologic-machine](references/biologic-machine.md)
- Run `puda machine commands biologic` to understand available commands
- Follow constraints in `references/biologic-machine.md`

### Centrifuge Machine (`machine_id: "centrifuge"`)

Use for **centrifugation, spin-downs, and phase or pellet separation**.

Capabilities:
- Sample spin-downs before or after handling steps
- Separation workflows based on centrifugal force
- Pelleting, clarification, and phase-separation preparation steps

Use this machine when:
- The user asks to centrifuge, spin, spin down, pellet, or clarify samples

Before command generation:
- Refer to: [centrifuge-machine](references/centrifuge-machine.md)
- Run `puda machine commands centrifuge` to understand available commands
- Follow constraints in `references/centrifuge-machine.md`

### Dobot M1Pro Machine (`machine_id: "dobot-m1pro"`)

Use for **gripper-based tube transfers between fixed positions**.

Capabilities:
- Pick-and-place tube handling with a gripper
- Moving tubes between predefined source and destination positions
- Position-based transfer steps for centrifuge-to-plate workflows

Use this machine when:
- The user asks to transfer tubes with a gripper
- The workflow involves moving tubes between known hardcoded positions
- A step references Dobot M1Pro positions such as centrifuge tube or MTP coordinates

Before command generation:
- Refer to: [dobot-m1pro-machine](references/dobot-m1pro-machine.md)
- Run `puda machine commands dobot-m1pro` to understand available commands
- Follow constraints in `references/dobot-m1pro-machine.md`

### BioShake Machine (`machine_id: "bioshake"`)

Use for **shaking, heating, and plate clamping operations**.

Capabilities:
- Shaking at a specified RPM for a given duration
- Heating (or cooling) to a target temperature and holding for a given duration
- Clamping and unclamping plates on the shaker
- Homing the shaker to its locked home position

Use this machine when:
- The user asks to shake, vortex, or mix a plate on a shaker
- The user asks to heat or incubate a plate at a specific temperature
- The user asks to clamp or unclamp a plate on the BioShake
- The workflow requires holding a plate at temperature while shaking

Before command generation:
- Run `puda machine commands bioshake` to understand available commands


## Selection Workflow

1. Parse user intent and identify the tasks.
2. Match intent to the machine capabilities above.
3. If machine selection is unclear or ambiguous, **ask the user** and wait for confirmation.
4. Load the corresponding reference file and CLI help.
5. Generate commands only after machine choice is confirmed.

## Output Guidance

When answering machine-selection questions:
- State the recommended machine and a one-line reason tied to capability.
- If uncertain, ask a direct clarification question instead of guessing.
