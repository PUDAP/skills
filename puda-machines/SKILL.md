# PUDA Machines

## Goal

Provide machine-selection and capability guidance for PUDA workflows, then load the correct machine reference before generating commands.

## Critical Rule

If you are unsure which machine should be used for a command, **ask the user** before proceeding.  
Do **not** assume.

### BioShake Machine (`machine_id: "bioshake"`)

Capabilities:
- Shaking at a specified RPM for a given duration
- Heating (or cooling) to a target temperature and holding for a given duration

- The user asks for gravimetric calibration, transfer error calculation, or balance feedback
- The task involves viscosity or transfer accuracy experiments needing mass data

Before use:
- Refer to: [balance-machine](references/balance-machine.md)
- Ask the user for the **Linux serial port** (`/dev/ttyUSB1`, etc.) — do not assume

### Opentrons Machine (`machine_id: "opentrons"`)

- Run `puda machine commands opentrons` to understand available commands
- Follow all command types, params, sequencing rules, and labware constraints in `references/opentrons-machine.md`


## Selection Workflow

1. Parse user intent and identify the tasks.
2. Match intent to the machine capabilities above.
3. If machine selection is unclear or ambiguous, **ask the user** and wait for confirmation.
4. Load the corresponding reference file and CLI help.
5. Generate commands only after machine choice is confirmed.

## Output Guidance

When answering machine-selection questions:
- State the recommended machine and a one-line reason tied to capability.
- If uncertain, ask a direct clarification question instead of guessing.

## Critical sequencing rules
1. `bioshake` must not be shaking while any machine is operating on a Bioshake position.
2. `centrifuge` must not be spinning while any machine is operating on a Centrifuge position.
3. `opentrons` protocols must always end with no tip attached to any pipette.
4. `opentrons` deck slot (`location`) for every `load_labware` command must be explicitly confirmed by the user — **never assume a slot**.
5. `opentrons` `capture_image` must be its own standalone protocol — never combined with pipetting commands in the same protocol.
6. `balance` — always call `startup()` before reading and `shutdown()` after. Always tare before a dispense step. Always verify `fresh == True` before using a reading.
